## This is a repository that I wanted to create for a long time. 
- It aims to have resources that I'm interested learn about tech. Feel free to contribute I'll review.
- I'm planning create 2 level of directory structure based on topic on top and specific category inside them at max.
- Currently I'm interested in Data Engineering and iOS development. I creted those directory. Each of them have their README files please use those to add resources.
